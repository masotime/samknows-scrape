# Samknows Scraping Project

This project does scraping (using `request`) of the HWZ forum thread at <http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/next-generation-broadband-network-ngbn-forum-320/samknows-singapore-campaign-3684527.html> for individual Samknows reports, parses HTML using `cheerio` and generates a JSON output representing individual report information.

Simply run samknows.js to generate the output. JSON will be output to `data.json`.
